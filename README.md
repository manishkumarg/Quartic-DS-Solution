 __***Conceptual Approach***__ <br>

1- Understanding the problem and the dataset. <br>
2- Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values. <br>
3- Understanding the relation between different variables with the target field  using P-value and Pearson coefficient. <br>
4- Those fields which have high statistical significance are taken into consideration for predicting the target field. <br>
5- Two approach has been taken and various Machine Learning Algorithms has been applied to each approach , the algorithm with **better score** which is **Decision Tree classifier** in this case has been used for Prediction. <br>
6- To check the accuracy of the prediction , further **Train-Test Split** is applied on the **data_train** and predicted target value is compared with actual value. <br>
7- The approch having **fewer number of difference between actual and predicted value** is used for prediction , which is **Approach 2** that is taking into consideration only those **variables having high Statistical significance.** <br>
